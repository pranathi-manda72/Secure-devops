# Secure DevOps Practices: CI/CD Security Integration

## Objective
Integrate security scanning tools like **SonarQube** or **OWASP ZAP** into a CI/CD pipeline to automatically identify vulnerabilities in the application code and deployed services.

---

## Tools Used
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions / Jenkins
- **Security Scanning Tools:**
  - [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) – Static code analysis to identify code vulnerabilities, bugs, and code smells.
  - [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) – Dynamic security scanning for web applications to find potential security risks.
- **Version Control:** Git / GitHub
- **Docker** (if scanning containerized applications)

---

## Pipeline Configuration

1. **Trigger:** On push or pull request to `main` branch.
2. **Build Stage:** Compile/build the application.
3. **Static Analysis (SonarQube):**
   - Scans the codebase for vulnerabilities, bugs, and code quality issues.
   - Generates a report (SonarQube dashboard or `.html` report).
4. **Dynamic Analysis (OWASP ZAP):**
   - Runs automated security tests against the deployed application.
   - Detects common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.
5. **Report Generation:**
   - Generates a detailed report of identified vulnerabilities.
   - Fail the pipeline if high-severity vulnerabilities are found.

---

## How to Run

**Using GitHub Actions:**
1. Push code to GitHub.
2. The workflow automatically triggers the security scans.
3. View the results in the workflow logs and attached reports.

**Using Jenkins:**
1. Pull code from Git repository.
2. Execute the configured Jenkins pipeline.
3. Access the SonarQube and OWASP ZAP dashboards for detailed reports.

---

## Deliverables
- **CI/CD pipeline configuration** (GitHub Actions workflow file / Jenkinsfile)
- **Vulnerability report** (generated by SonarQube / OWASP ZAP)
- Summary of issues categorized by severity (High, Medium, Low)

---

## Observations / Findings
- Example: 
  - SonarQube detected 3 code smells and 1 critical security vulnerability in the login module.
  - OWASP ZAP detected potential XSS vulnerability in the user input form.
- Actions recommended: Fix high-severity issues immediately and review medium/low issues during regular code maintenance.
